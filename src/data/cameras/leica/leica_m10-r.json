With a 40MP sensor, it's the highest resolution M-series camera yet (as of July 2020), and Leica claims that it offers more dynamic range and less noise than previous models. It has the same ultra-quiet shutter of other recent M models, and can now take exposures as long as 16 minutes.The large, bright line viewfinder has automatic parallax correction and a magnification of 0.73x. A 3\" touchscreen display offers a modern interface. Wi-Fi (2.4Ghz) is built in, but Bluetooth is not. As with all Leica cameras, build quality is first rate.","ProductPhotos":["/files/p/products/leica_m10-r/shots/b4ec77cae06145b8a98a85af1304155e.png","/files/p/products/leica_m10-r/shots/f40460553a9748fd826f88f0f5efcd3d.png","/files/p/products/leica_m10-r/shots/fe06901a35134de3b154ccff7da4d144.png","/files/p/products/leica_m10-r/shots/0f1e227855ca47868171280e8694d17a.png","/files/p/products/leica_m10-r/shots/07eb7cd36488443f8f4e30daf5dd6f5c.png","/files/p/products/leica_m10-r/shots/8ad00f8d7c4340ffb4d38e42b8cc4c14.png"],"ReviewSummary":null},"ReviewScore":0,"ShortSpecs":["41 megapixels","3″ screen","Full frame sensor"],"Specs":{"AEBracketing":"","Announced":"Jul 16, 2020","AperturePriority":"Yes","ArticulatedLCD":"Fully articulated","Autofocus":"","AutofocusAssistLamp":"","Battery":"Battery Pack","BatteryDescription":"BC-SCL5 lithium-ion battery & charger","BatteryLifeCIPA":"","BodyMaterial":"Magnesium alloy","BodyType":"Rangefinder-style mirrorless","BoostedISOMinimum":"","BuiltInFlash":"No","BuyingOptions":"Check prices","ColorFilterArray":"Primary color filter","ColorSpace":"","ContinuousDrive":"","CustomWhiteBalance":"Yes","DigitalZoom":"","Dimensions":"139 x 39 x 80 mm (5.47 x 1.54 x 3.15″)","DriveModes":"","EffectivePixels":"41 megapixels","EnvironmentallySealed":"Yes","ExposureCompensation":"","ExposureModes":["Aperture priority","Manual"],"ExternalFlash":"Yes (via hot shoe)","FileFormat":["JPEG","DNG (14-bit)"],"FlashModes":"","FlashXSyncSpeed":"1/180 sec","FocalLengthEquiv":"","FocalLengthMultiplier":"1×","Format":"","GPS":"Optional","GPSNotes":"","HDMI":"","HeadphonePort":"No","ISO":"Auto, 100-50000","ImageRatioWh":"3:2","ImageStabilization":"No","JPEGQualityLevels":"","LensMount":"Leica M","LiveView":"Yes","MSRP":"$8295","MacroFocusRange":"","ManualExposureMode":"Yes","ManualFocus":"Yes","MaxResolution":"7864 x 5200","MaximumAperture":"","MaximumShutterSpeed":"1/4000 sec","MaximumShutterSpeedElectronic":"","MeteringModes":"","Microphone":"None","MicrophonePort":"No","MinimumShutterSpeed":"960 sec","Modes":"","NormalFocusRange":"","NumberOfFocusPoints":"","OpticalZoom":"","OrientationSensor":"Yes","OtherResolutions":"","Processor":"Maestro II","RemoteControl":"Yes (cable release)","Resolutions":"","ReviewPreview":"Read video review ...\n                                    \n                                    \n                                        Jul 23, 2020","SceneModes":"","ScreenDots":"1,036,800","ScreenSize":"3″","ScreenType":"TFT LCD","SelfTimer":"Yes","SensorPhotoDetectors":"","SensorSize":"Full frame (36 x 24 mm)","SensorType":"CMOS","ShutterPriority":"No","Speaker":"None","StorageIncluded":"","StorageTypes":"SD/SDHC/SDXC card","SubjectSceneModes":"No","TimelapseRecording":"","TouchScreen":"Yes","USB":"","USBCharging":"","UncompressedFormat":"RAW","VideographyNotes":"","ViewfinderCoverage":"","ViewfinderMagnification":"0.73×","ViewfinderResolution":"","ViewfinderType":"Optical (rangefinder)","WBBracketing":"","WeightIncBatteries":"660 g (1.46 lb / 23.28 oz)","WhiteBalancePresets":"","Wireless":"Built-In","WirelessNotes":"802.11b/g/n"},"URL":"/products/leica/slrs/leica_m10-r"},"openGraphData":[{"property":"og:image","content":"https://img.digicamfinder.com/meta0001.png","key":"ogimage"},{"property":"og:image:secure_url","content":"https://img.digicamfinder.com/meta0001.png","key":"ogimagesecureurl"},{"property":"og:title","content":"Leica M10-R (2020) Digital Camera · Digicam Finder","key":"ogtitle"},{"property":"og:description","content":"41 MP · Full frame (36 x 24 mm) · CMOS · Full spec →","key":"ogdesc"},{"property":"og:type","content":"website","key":"website"},{"property":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image","key":"twcard"},{"property":"twitter:title","content":"Leica M10-R (2020) Digital Camera · Digicam Finder","key":"twtitle"},{"property":"twitter:description","content":"41 MP · Full frame (36 x 24 mm) · CMOS · Full spec →","key":"twdesc"},{"property":"twitter:image","content":"https://img.digicamfinder.com/meta0001.png","key":"twimg"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
