It has sensor-shift image stabilization built right in, and the camera can move the sensor in order to produce 96 Megapixel images. The SL2-S's body is built like a tank and has an IP54 certification for weather-sealing. The camera's touchscreen LCD is 3.2\" in size and sports 2.1 million dots, while the large EVF has a resolution of 5.76 million dots. The SL2-S has two SD card slots, both of which are compatible with high-speed UHS-II media. A small LCD on the top plate lets you quickly view and adjust camera settings.The SL2-S can capture DCI and UHD 4K video at 60 frames/sec (with an APS-C crop; it's 30p without one) and up to 180 fps in Full HD mode. The SL2-S has both mic and headphone sockets, as well as a full-size HDMI port. Waveforms, color bars with a test tone and automatic follow-focus will be added in 2021.","ProductPhotos":["/files/p/products/leica_sl2s/shots/58ebc3c3c952490caf03e1b4ac3d0995.png","/files/p/products/leica_sl2s/shots/ffb28565f2eb4d229061d2a585da5d1a.png","/files/p/products/leica_sl2s/shots/337cad6ca1f44550a0a38b16633baa4d.png","/files/p/products/leica_sl2s/shots/e9f5bffb7c8f49b0818c72ebdcef916a.png","/files/p/products/leica_sl2s/shots/63353106c5904bfcab655b07f817cb5b.png"],"ReviewSummary":null},"ReviewScore":0,"ShortSpecs":["24
