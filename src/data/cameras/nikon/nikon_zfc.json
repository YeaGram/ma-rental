The top plate is loaded with dials and also has a small screen that displays the current aperture. The Z fc has a hybrid AF system with 209 phase-detect points, along with face and eye detection, for both people and animals. The camera can capture 4K/30p video plus high speed 120 fps footage at Full HD. The Z fc has a fully articulating 1.04M-dot LCD as well as a 2.36M-dot EVF. It supports USB Power Delivery, which allows the camera to be operated when connected to a laptop charger or power brick. It has a single SD card slot and uses the same EN-EL25 battery as the Z50.","ProductPhotos":["/files/p/products/nikon_zfc/shots/77c05785f529488ea818489beb169bfb.png","/files/p/products/nikon_zfc/shots/d144c210d2ce4d9285ead54374500abb.png","/files/p/products/nikon_zfc/shots/b8d73ece6343465fa53815be156063d2.jpeg","/files/p/products/nikon_zfc/shots/94732fe8054f43d584bf5ba6c3d5733e.png","/files/p/products/nikon_zfc/shots/b85e2138ca58442da29d418618d2e971.png","/files/p/products/nikon_zfc/shots/2eddcd63bb0b4e94bec4b58a3276b43f.png"],"ReviewSummary":{"Conclusion":"The Nikon Z fc is an APS-C mirrorless camera that successfully brings back the design of the company's film cameras. It offers plenty of hands-on controls, a vlogger-friendly fully articulating touchscreen, excellent still and video quality, and plenty of customizability. It could use refinement in a few areas, but for those looking for an eye-catching camera that can capture the moment for social media and more, the Z fc is a solid choice.","GoodFor":"Those looking for a light, inexpensive and stylish ILC with direct controls and vlogging-friendly features.","NotSoGoodFor":"Those who prefer a more substantial-feeling body, best-in-class autofocus or a wider selection of native lenses."}},"ReviewScore":86,"ShortSpecs":["21 megapixels","3″ screen","APS-C sensor"],"Specs":{"AEBracketing":"±5 (2, 3, 5, 7 frames at 1/3 EV, 1/2 EV, 2/3 EV, 1 EV steps)","Announced":"Jun 29, 2021","AperturePriority":"Yes","ArticulatedLCD":"Fully articulated","Autofocus":["Contrast Detect (sensor)","Phase Detect","Multi-area","Center","Selective single-point","Tracking","Single","Continuous","Touch","Face Detection","Live View"],"AutofocusAssistLamp":"Yes","Battery":"Battery Pack","BatteryDescription":"EN-EL25 lithium-ion battery & charger","BatteryLifeCIPA":"300","BodyMaterial":"Magnesium alloy","BodyType":"SLR-style mirrorless","BoostedISOMaximum":"204800","BoostedISOMinimum":"100","BuiltInFlash":"No","BuyingOptions":"$856.95 -
