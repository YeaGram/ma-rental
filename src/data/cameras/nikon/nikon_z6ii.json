Offering a 24MP full-frame sensor, in-body 5-axis stabilization and high-quality 4K video shooting, the Z6 II provides a similar feature set to its predecessor, but with some differences. Improvements include (and mostly stem from) the addition of a second Expeed 6 image processor, which allows for faster continuous shooting (now up to 14 fps) improved autofocus and 4K/60p video from an APS-C crop (coming via firmware). Physically the Z6 II is almost identical to the original Z6, but now features twin CFexpress / SD card slots, and provision for a vertical control grip (available separately).","ProductPhotos":["/files/p/products/nikon_z6ii/shots/64bb11c95bac4b7cb8acdf86c34a7dd6.png","/files/p/products/nikon_z6ii/shots/764dc10f20f745a8b5b73a26f42f7644.png"],"ReviewSummary":{"Conclusion":"The Z6 II is a camera that does well at just about everything. It's comfortable to shoot with and its performance is reliably good. Its AF system is effective, though not at simple to use as its rivals', and battery life isn't particularly impressive, but if you're looking for an enthusiast camera that will do a bit of everything, it's well worth considering.","GoodFor":"Stills and video capture in a variety of situations","NotSoGoodFor":"Carefree shooting in fast-changing conditions"}},"ReviewScore":89,"ShortSpecs":["25 megapixels","3.2″ screen","Full frame sensor"],"Specs":{"AEBracketing":"","Announced":"Oct 14, 2020","AperturePriority":"Yes","ArticulatedLCD":"Tilting","Autofocus":["Contrast Detect (sensor)","Phase Detect","Multi-area","Center","Selective single-point","Tracking","Single","Continuous","Touch","Face Detection","Live View"],"AutofocusAssistLamp":"Yes","Battery":"Battery Pack","BatteryDescription":"EN-EL15c lithium-ion battery & charger","BatteryLifeCIPA":"410","BodyMaterial":"Magnesium alloy","BodyType":"SLR-style mirrorless","BoostedISOMaximum":"204800","BoostedISOMinimum":"50","BuiltInFlash":"No","BuyingOptions":"$1,996.95 -
