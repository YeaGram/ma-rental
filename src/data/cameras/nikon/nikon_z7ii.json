Offering a 46MP full-frame sensor, in-camera 5-axis stabilization and high-quality 4K video shooting, the Z7 II provides a similar feature set to its predecessor, but with some differences. Improvements include (and mostly stem from) the addition of a second Expeed 6 image processor, which allows for faster continuous shooting (now up to 10fps) improved autofocus and 4k/60p video with a modest crop. Physically the Z7 II is almost identical to the original Z7, but now features twin CFe / SD card slots, and provision for a vertical control grip (available separately).","ProductPhotos":["/files/p/products/nikon_z7ii/shots/d4d8529240e349509402fd2e09e30103.png","/files/p/products/nikon_z7ii/shots/5c363740b6544187b5847a7ed139e581.png","/files/p/products/nikon_z7ii/shots/5e8ce8b2d1a44fb7a6715ed549cf45e2.png"],"ReviewSummary":{"Conclusion":"The Z7 II is a very capable all-rounder, boosted by the addition of twin card slots and the option to add a battery grip. It offers superb image quality, solid autofocus and good video specs. But it's only really its slightly lower price that makes it stand out from a very competitive group. Thoroughly likable.","GoodFor":"Landscape photography and portraiture","NotSoGoodFor":"Demanding action shooting, regular changes of subject type"}},"ReviewScore":89,"ShortSpecs":["46 megapixels","3.2″ screen","Full frame sensor"],"Specs":{"AEBracketing":"","Announced":"Oct 14, 2020","AperturePriority":"Yes","ArticulatedLCD":"Tilting","Autofocus":["Contrast Detect (sensor)","Phase Detect","Multi-area","Center","Selective single-point","Tracking","Single","Continuous","Touch","Face Detection","Live View"],"AutofocusAssistLamp":"Yes","Battery":"Battery Pack","BatteryDescription":"EN-EL15c lithium-ion battery & charger","BatteryLifeCIPA":"420","BodyMaterial":"Magnesium alloy","BodyType":"SLR-style mirrorless","BoostedISOMaximum":"102400","BoostedISOMinimum":"32","BuiltInFlash":"No","BuyingOptions":"$2,996.95 -
